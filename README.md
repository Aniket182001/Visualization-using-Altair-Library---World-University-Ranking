<h3 align="center">Visualization using Altair Library--World University Ranking</h3>

This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing the World University Ranking dataset using the Altair library. The dataset includes information on various universities, their rankings, and key performance indicators. The project encompasses essential steps such as data cleaning and transformation to ensure the dataset's integrity and usability.


##Key Components:
#Dataset Overview:

Source: World University Ranking
Attributes: The dataset contains information on university rankings, country, national rank, quality of education, alumni employment, quality of faculty, publications, influence, citations, and other relevant metrics.
Data Cleaning:

Handling Missing Values: Addressing missing values in certain columns, ensuring completeness.
Data Type Conversion: Ensuring the correct data types for each attribute.
Duplicate Removal: Eliminating duplicate records for accurate analysis.
Data Transformation:

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance analytical capabilities.
Aggregation: Aggregating data based on specific criteria for a more comprehensive view.
Normalization: Scaling numerical data to a standard range for consistent comparisons.
Statistical Description:

Descriptive Statistics: Utilizing statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) to summarize and understand the dataset.
Correlation Analysis: Exploring relationships between different variables to uncover patterns.
Hypothesis Testing: Conducting statistical tests (e.g., t-test) for deeper insights.
Visualization with Altair:

Scatterplots: Creating scatterplots to visualize the relationship between variables, such as 'score' and 'quality_of_education.'
Heatmaps: Generating heatmaps for a comprehensive view of data density and trends.
Bar Charts: Visualizing the distribution of universities in the top 100 based on country rankings.
Scatter Matrix: Exploring multivariate relationships using a scatter matrix.
This project aims to provide meaningful insights into the World University Ranking dataset through effective data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis, ultimately enhancing decision-making processes in the academic domain. The visualization aspect, powered by Altair, adds a dynamic and interactive layer to the exploration of complex educational data.
